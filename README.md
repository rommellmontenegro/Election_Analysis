# Election Audit

## Overview of Project
    *This latest challenge allow us to use Python to review a few critical statistics about the county level performance of candidates in the data file.
    *We got to employ some of the modules, functions, automated data retrieval, analysis, and reporting into different formats, csv and in the terminal.

## Purpose
    *The purpose of this exercse allowed us to combine a wide set of Python capabilities like lists, dictionaries, for loops, and conditional logical statements.
    *The use of MS Visual Code to write code was an enhanced experience of how to debug code as you write it or when it run to fine tune it.

## Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

    * How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
        -369,711 votes in total were cast in this congressional election.

    * Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
        -Denver county received 82.8% of the vote or 306,055 votes.
        -Jefferson county received 10.5% of the vote or 38,855 votes.
        -Arapahoe county received 6.7% of the vote or 24,801 votes.

    * Which county had the largest number of votes?
        -Denver county received 306,055 votes, the most out of the three counties.

    * Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
        -Diana DeGette got 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes.
        -Charles Casper Stockham got 23.0% of the vote with 85,213 votes.
        -Raymon Anthony Doane got 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes.

    * Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
        -Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% of total votes and 272,892 votes.

    * Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. 
        Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
        -Wth additional variables about demographics relevant election issues this script could be used to perform more insight analysis.
        -A larger data file could yield a better understanding about where any given candidate or party could focus their efforts.
        -Python could also be used to automate the reporting of results so that Iowa's prmary election results weren't totally fouled up by a totally manual process.
